# Health Insurance Analysis by Implementing Probability
Health insurance is an important part of the modern healthcare system that provides financial protection for individuals and families against unexpected medical expenses. Analysis of health insurance data is crucial in understanding the health spending patterns, risks, and behaviors of insurance customers. In this analysis, we will explore a health insurance dataset that includes various information such as age, gender, body mass index (BMI), region, smoking habits, and insurance costs. The purpose of this analysis is to identify significant patterns and trends in the data, understand the factors that influence health insurance costs, and provide important insights for insurance companies in decision-making and better service to customers.
